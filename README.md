# Bookmarklet-based token logger
> ## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: THIS REPO DEMONSTRATES A TOKEN GRABBER. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE CODE TO PROPERLY OBTAIN A TOKEN MALICIOUSLY.
For educational purposes only; used to educate my staff team to avoid these.  
An implementation of a Discord token grabber that has been going around recently, w/o the webhook part,
the token is hashed and sent as an alert to the browser.  
This can, _irl_, easily be replaced with a webhook pipeline, or other more complicated mechanisms.  

`dangerNoodle.js` contains the JS of the bookmarklet.  
`index.html` is an example page.
